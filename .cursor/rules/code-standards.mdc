## Vue.js Best Practices
- Use Composition API exclusively with `<script setup>` syntax
- Use `ref()` and `reactive()` for state management
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Use `onMounted`, `onUnmounted` etc. for lifecycle hooks
- Use PascalCase for component names

## Code Quality
- Remove unnecessary comments - only explain why, not what
- Suggest improvements for repetitive or unclear code
- Follow DRY principle - eliminate code duplication
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files

## File Structure
- Keep components in `/src/components/`
- Keep pages in `/src/pages/`
- Keep services in `/src/services/`
- Keep models in `/src/models/`
- Keep router config in `/src/router/`

## No Emojis Policy
- Never use emojis in code, comments, or documentation
- Maintain professional communication
