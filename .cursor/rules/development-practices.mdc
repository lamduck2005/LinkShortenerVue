## Error Handling
- Suggest proper error handling for async operations
- Provide meaningful user feedback
- Use appropriate logging levels

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Prevent XSS attacks
- Never expose sensitive API keys

## Testing
- Suggest unit tests for utility functions
- Recommend component and integration tests
- Test critical user flows

## Git Best Practices
- Write descriptive commit messages in English
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use descriptive branch names (feature/, bugfix/, refactor/)

## Development Workflow
- Suggest code improvements during reviews
- Update documentation when adding features
- Keep dependencies updated and remove unused packages
